## Beam Solver v1.0
Welcome to my very first web dev project!

Beam Solver is a structural calculator for solving simply supported beams built with React and JavaScript. The current version of Beam Solver is only capable of solving statically determinate structures, meaning a single beam with only two supports. However there's no limit on the number of external loads acting on the structure. To solve structures with more than two unknowns, we will need more equations, and this feature, along with shear force and moment diagrams will be coming soon!
